// A. Beautiful Matrix -> striver cp sheet third question
//In this question you might think of using  a 2d array to take input and traversing 
//Then you are also begineer just like many more grow up 
//....Approach....
// To find the maximum nubmer of steps to take the 1 to the center which is arr[3][3]
//we are going to use simmple maths if n==1 then ans=abs(i-3) +abs(j-3); //here the abs is an inbuilt function in c++ which conver the negative nubmer to positive and only return the absolute mod of the obtained value d
