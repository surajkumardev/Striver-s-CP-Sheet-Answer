//-> Approach how to solve this question 
//-> After reading this question you might find you not able to understand it what it is telling you 
//-> So in this question the variable n is there which denotes the nubmer of test cases that the program should run 
//-> Then we have a value x that has to be initialized with the value of 0 
//-> Then we have to take a string input which have either "++x" or "--x" or may be reverse of this 
//-> Inside the while loop we are running for different test cases first we take the input of the string then we check is the value at the s[1] =='+" or not 
//-> Choosing the first index has its own meaning as we are taking input for both the ++x and x++ so the value at the s[1] will check both the condition 
//-> and then s[1] ='+' increase the value of x by 1 else --x decrease it 
//-> At last print the answer
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int t; //number of differnt test cases
    cin >> t;
    int x=0;

    string s;
    while (t--){
        cin >> s; //user sai the ++x or --x ko input liya hai 
        if (s[1] == '+')
        {
            ++x;
        }
        else
        {
            --x;
        }
    }

    cout << x << endl;
    return 0;
}
